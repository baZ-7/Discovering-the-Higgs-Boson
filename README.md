# Discovering-the-Higgs-Boson
Project:  a statistical analysis for the likelihood of discovering the Higgs Boson with a 5- sigma significance using computational algorithms. 

The final probability estimated for observing a Higgs Signal with minimum 5-sigma significance is 53.09%, found using an assumed Higgs mass of mH = 125.1 Â± 1.4GeV /c2 along with a few other statistical errors. 

1 - computationalprojectfunctions

containing all the functions used for each of the computational tasks

2 - computationalprojectplots

used to analyse the different functions used and to produce values and plots for the project


The computational project plots file should produce all the plots used in the report including some key calculations once you press run code assuming that the functions file have been successfully imported.

The code commented represents the testing/additional validation that I have done.
